        <p className="text-dark ">
         <b>Body mass index (BMI) </b> is a value derived from the mass (weight) and
          height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the
          square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2,
          resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. The BMI may be
          determined using a table or chart which displays BMI as a function
          of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI
          categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to
          metric units for the calculation). The BMI is a convenient rule of
          thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal
          weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and
          bone) and height. Major adult BMI classifications are underweight
          (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to
          29.9), and obese (30 or more).When used to predict an individual's
          health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI
          has limitations that can make it less useful than some of the
          alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal
          obesity, short stature, or unusually high muscle mass. BMIs under 20
          and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with
          the risk increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.
